JSON and dynamic content

Instructions
Use JSON to create a collection of “items”, displaying them in a structured manner on your page. Each item must have at least three pieces of information or data that are used when displaying- text, images, numbers, colors, etc…

Some ideas are a portfolio page, collection of music, “about us” section with individual profiles, or something abstract and artful.

Use all your skills as a designer/developer; this should be laid out nicely and demonstrate as much effort as the other websites you’ve made.
